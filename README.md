# Resumé

My online resumé. Made using a base template from ShareLaTeX (the original ShareLaTeX link broke, so here's the link to the author's github: [posquit0/Awesome-CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV)).

### Development
As stated on the source template GitHub page, this assumes you have latex installed.

On Arch Linux:
```
sudo pacman -S texlive-core texlive-latexextra texlive-xetex
```

To compile:
```
make
```
It will then spit out a bunch of errors, but the `LiamNiehusStaab_resume.pdf` has been compiled fully.
